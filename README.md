This bot provides animated gifs on-command, generates text, and aggregates data from [Steamworks API endpoints](https://partner.steamgames.com/) into a digestible format.

All content provided by this bot is related to the [Rivals of Aether](https://rivalsofaether.com/) video game.

The primary function of Betterburn is to provide Discord servers with a set of currated animated gifs - some educational, and some for posterity.

Animated gifs are generated with an embed explaining the series of inputs.

Betterburn also uses the Steamworks API to generate a leaderboard identical to the one displayed in the video game. These leaderboards are rendered with accurate ranking data and may use various data sets.

Using a custom font file, Betterburn generates text pixel-by-pixel that looks identical to the one used in Rivals of Aether. Each section title is generated with Betterburn's text generation feature.
